## Introduction

Hello, I am Srayansh Gupta, a 2-year student currently pursuing B.tech from Ajay Kumar Garg Engineering College. 

## Things that I have learned Till Now
I was given a task to make portfolio which should include navbar, contact form and my projects.

*Github Repository* - https://github.com/SRAYANSH-GUPTA/Portfolio  <br>
*Hosted Link* - https://portfolio-tau-gules-76.vercel.app/

In this website I have learned how to add media queries to make website fit for every device and I tried to use grids and flexbox.

There are some flaws in website and will be fixed soon such as working of hamburger icon.
